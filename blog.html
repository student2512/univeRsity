				<h2>Our Certificate & Online Progams For 2023</h2>
				<p>A university should in theory teach every subject. The university is generally regarded as a                   formal institution that has its origin in the Medieval Christian tradition. European higher                       education took place for hundreds of years in cathedral schools or monastic schools.</p>
				<br>
				<p>University education refers to a level of education that is offered at universities. This                     type education normally follows upon a successful completion of education at secondary school or                 other mid-level colleges and tertiary institutions, students are normally awarded academic                       degrees after going through an undergraduate or a postgraduate education by the respective                       universities.University education takes high school, tertiary and college education to a higher                  level and students are required to major in a major field of study that will form their career                   once they graduate. It is for this purpose that university education must lead to the                            development of the learner in all aspects and not just on career development.</p>
                <br>
				<p>One of the most important functions of university education is developing the learnerâ€™s                       character and training them on real-life expectations. One might argue that these should be                      already developed before entering the university, they should, unfortunately, the education                      systems at pre-university levels do not give the learner an opportunity to discover himself and                  have an uninterrupted character growth. This is due to congestion in the syllabi as education at                 this level is more generalized and as a result, learners spend most of their time grasping new                   ideas given in class. A student gets to have a complete character evolution once he enters the                   university and it is common for a person who was troublesome in his teenage years get out of                     university mature and well behaved.</p>
